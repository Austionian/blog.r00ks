summary: "Books born from talks beget thought-leaders and co-opt a book's ethos, furthering an artifical importance and myopic thinking. This post explains why your book should have been an email and in all actuality probably is just that."

I want to begin by looking at Wittgenstein's Duck Rabbit:
<Image alt="signal" src="/static/images/interpellated-agile/duck_rabbit.png" width={645} height={387} />

Is it a picture of a duck or a rabbit. Logically it can't be both. 

Now with this same mindset, imagine a book by an author who is active on LinkedIn. Is it a book or is it an email in the appearance of a book.

It's a book just like *Ulysses*, you say? They both have covers and some pages with writing on them. (I imagine the business book has diagrams.) But are they the same. What does it mean that these two things share a medium, but are in direct opposition in content and what ultimately they're trying to share.

There's a post on LinkIn of pile of books. The caption is about an upcoming conference and picture is of their published books. One stacked on top of the other. The same author appearing multiple times. It leads to importance and makes me think wow this conference must be full of erudite and intelligent speakers. *I should read those books*.

And then I see a comment by one of the authors of said book pile:
>I can’t help but think of the phrase “standing on the shoulders of giants” as I see this stack of books and the admiration I have for >those who authored them.

And the post's author's response:
>So perfectly well said brother. Exactly how I feel about you and all of the other giants of purposeful leadership represented in this >stack. Can’t wait to spend three days in May igniting hearts and minds together.

There isn't a hint of sarcasm in sight. How did we get here? What is the ideology here?
