summary: "Books born from talks beget thought-leaders and co-opt a book's ethos, furthering an artifical importance and myopic thinking. This post explains why your book should have been an email and in all actuality probably is just that."

I want to begin by looking at Wittgenstein's Duck Rabbit:
<Image alt="signal" src="/static/images/interpellated-agile/duck_rabbit.png" width={645} height={387} />

Is it a picture of a duck or a rabbit. Logically it can't be both.

Now with this same mindset, imagine a book by an author who is active on LinkedIn. Is it a book or is it an email in the appearance of a book.

It's a book just like _Ulysses_, you say? They both have covers and some pages with writing on them. (I imagine the business book has graphics disguised as adult diagrams.) But are they the same? What does it mean that these two things share a medium, but are in direct opposition in content and what ultimately they're trying to share.

Look now further, there's a post on LinkIn of pile of books. The caption is about an upcoming conference and we learn that all these books piled high are written by authors set to speak at the upcoming conference. One stacked on top of the other. The same author appearing multiple times. It leads to importance and makes me think _wow this conference must be full of erudite and intelligent speakers. I should read those books_.

And then read a comment by one of the authors of said book pile:

> I can’t help but think of the phrase “standing on the shoulders of giants” as I see this stack of books and the admiration I have for those who authored them.

And the post's author's response:

> So perfectly well said [sic] brother. Exactly how I feel about you and all of the other giants of purposeful leadership represented in this stack. Can’t wait to spend three days in May igniting hearts and minds together.

There isn't a hint of sarcasm in sight. How did we get here? What is the ideology here? Are we truly living in a time of _business-thought-leadership_ Reniassance?

Who's hearts are being ignited by this? And what does it mean that one thinks it does at all?

Those books can't be on par with real giants like Joyce and Morrison. Can they? They can't really be touching peoples' innermost selves on visceral level, can they? _Igniting hearts and minds_.

Maybe I'm naive to think that they really mean this. Maybe just like their book length emails these comments are just another thing of marketing, the conference as well. Hyping up the masses for cold lunch buffets.

Here's the thing about every conference I've ever been to. They're in a lifeless conference room in a generic hotel. The good ones include windows. Sometimes the keynote speaker speaks with charisma. Most of the time engagement is lacking. All of the time, everytime, the most passion I see out of attendees is when the talk is over and it's lunch hour. These are people I thought just a minute ago were edging on sleep, catatonic and empty. But when the talk before lunch is over, seeing oversized rumps leave chairs with enuthisam and a vigor said rumps haven't possessed for 20 years is a sight on par with that of Yellowstone's gyser. These are hearts and minds refortified by a thought of hotel food and weak coffee. These are people attending a conference and really treating it like a weeklong quasi-vacation.
