summary: "Re-reading the Rust Book and second takes."

I first read the Rust Book sometime around a year ago. I think I finished it initially this February.

I remember at the time, Twitter comments like, "I guess it's time to re-read the Rust Book." And I always thought I didn't want to be that person. So but while I'm re-reading the Rust Book it's not because I'm re-learning Rust. I've using Rust on the side for the whole year, but thought I really want to get the fundamentals down. So here I am.

It's a much lighter read the second time, but also the tidbits, the tiny corners of the language that you miss the first time really stand out the second.
