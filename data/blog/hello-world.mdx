Welcome to my blog. This is a space where I hope to write more, both about the tech that Iâ€™m working with, what I'm reading and my impressions. This is a pursuit to note down thoughts and share, and I hope you find it useful.

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2 post-img">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image alt="signal" src="/static/images/hello-world/signal.webp" width={500} height={667} />
  </div>
</div>

Thanks and, again, welcome.

Austin
